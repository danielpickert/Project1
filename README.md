## Current Features

* Users can answer questions based on their knowledge of The Office

I categorized this project into 3 categories with goals I wanted to accomplish:

* Bronze - Users can answer 10 functioning questions that, after clicking "Done", provide you with how many you answered correctly

* Silver - Visually appealing CSS with images and clean layout

* Gold - Different messages/gifs that appear based on how many questions the User answered correctly

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## Installation Instructions

1. Fork and clone the [project repository](https://github.com/danielpickert/Project1)
2. Open code text editor

## Contribute 

* Figure out why ```<img id="gif">``` is showing up as an error in HTML validator. If I change the syntax, gifs don't appear anymore after clicking "Done".
* Add a timer
* Add questions & answers, along with messages/gifs that appear based on number answered correctly
